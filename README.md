# GryffinEngine #
=============

### 2D Game Engine written in Haxe ###

The Gryffin Engine is a project of mine that I've been pouring my soul into for a little over two years now.The documentation
is ghastly for now, I'm afraid (I'm sorry), but if you'd like to take a swim around this ocean of code, be my guest. It's mostly stable,
and I'll have an example of it in action online soon.
